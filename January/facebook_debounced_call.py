This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a function f, and N return a debounced f of N milliseconds.

That is, as long as the debounced f continues to be invoked, 
f itself will not be called for N milliseconds.
"""
# Debouncing means to supress the call to a function within a given timeframe, 
# say you call a function 100 times within 1 second 
# but you only want to allow the function to run once every 10 seconds 
# a debounce decorated function would run the function once 10 seconds after 
# the last function call if no new function calls
